Hi guys! This was my first try to make a neural network from scratch using plain mathematics and python's magical library NumPy which made it easier to represent the complex mathematics involved in constructing and training a neural network
Here you'll find 2 python scripts, one works on the IRIS dataset and the other one on Adult income dataset.
I'll be updating this repository with new scripts as i indulge in different datasets.
